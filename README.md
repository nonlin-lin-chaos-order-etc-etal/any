# any
A multieditable platform for multiplatform software development; a tool to employ anything possible heterogeneously. Unlimited deep plunge-dig-plunge-repeat and unlimited deep security. Should include Ruby Goldberg Machines schemes, equality schemes, and pyramid-like schemes, among other types and things. Should include and integrate any programming languages, any software and systems development platforms and any programming paradigms. Freeform. Should have a multiplatform multivcs-enabled easy point and click editing of the code, and forkable free multieditable vcs mesh concept. And anything more, as this is free/libre opensource software licensed under GNU GPLv3+.
